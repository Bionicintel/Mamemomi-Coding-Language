Here’s a setup.py file that you can use to package your custom programming language. This file will allow others to install your language as a Python package, and also makes it easy to manage dependencies, versions, and metadata for distribution.

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="my-language",  # Name of your language package
    version="0.1",  # Initial version number
    description="A simple custom programming language built from scratch using Python.",
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),  # Long description from your README file
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    author="Your Name",  # Your name or your organization
    author_email="your.email@example.com",  # Your email address
    url="https://github.com/username/my-language",  # Replace with the URL of your GitHub repository
    packages=find_packages(),  # Automatically find packages (like lexer.py, parser.py, etc.)
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",  # Adjust if you're using a different license
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires='>=3.6',  # Specify the minimum Python version required
    install_requires=[
        # List any external dependencies here (e.g., if you're using a library like `ply` for lexing/parsing)
        # Example:
        # 'ply>=3.11',
    ],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            # This allows users to run the language directly from the command line (optional)
            'my-language = main:main',  # 'my-language' will run the main() function in main.py
        ],
    },
    project_urls={
        "Source": "https://github.com/username/my-language",  # Replace with your actual GitHub repo URL
        "Bug Tracker": "https://github.com/username/my-language/issues",
    },
)

Explanation of Key Sections:

	•	name: The name of your package (e.g., "my-language").
	•	version: The initial version number of your package.
	•	description: A short description of your language.
	•	long_description: This reads the README.md file, so it will display the detailed information about the language when people install it from PyPI or view the package information.
	•	author and author_email: Your name and contact email.
	•	url: The URL to your project’s repository (e.g., GitHub).
	•	packages: Uses find_packages() to automatically detect and include all Python files (e.g., lexer.py, parser.py, etc.).
	•	classifiers: Standard metadata to help people find your package and understand its compatibility.
	•	python_requires: Specifies that the package works with Python 3.6 and above.
	•	install_requires: If you have any external dependencies, you can list them here. For example, you could include ply (a Python library for lexing and parsing) if you’re using it in your language.
	•	entry_points: This section is optional, but it allows you to create a command-line interface (CLI) for your language. In this case, the my-language command would call the main() function in your main.py file.
	•	project_urls: This section provides additional links, such as your repository and issue tracker.

Additional Notes:

	•	Dependencies: If your language uses any external libraries (e.g., for lexing or parsing), you can include them in the install_requires section.
	•	Entry Point: The entry_points section is optional and allows users to run your language via a simple command like my-language in the terminal. This is useful if you want to make your language executable directly from the command line without having to type python main.py.
